* Dataset:
  1. The Human Protein Atlas (version 19) 
    1. Tissue Atlas: The Tissue Atlas contains information regarding the expression profiles of human genes both on the mRNA and protein level. The protein expression data from 44 normal human tissue types is derived from antibody-based protein profiling using immunohistochemistry .
    2. Cell Atlas: The Cell Atlas provides high-resolution insights into the expression and spatio-temporal distribution of proteins within human cells. Using a panel of 64 cell lines to represent various cell populations in different organs and tissues of the human body, the mRNA expression of all human genes are characterized by deep RNA-sequencing.
  2.  CCLE (latest version): The CCLE (Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia) project is a collaboration between the Broad Institute, and the Novartis Institutes for Biomedical Research and its Genomics Institute of the Novartis Research Foundation to conduct a detailed genetic and pharmacologic characterization of a large panel of human cancer models, to develop integrated computational analyses that link distinct pharmacologic vulnerabilities to genomic patterns and to translate cell line integrative genomics into cancer patient stratification. The CCLE provides public access to genomic data, analysis and visualization for over 1100 cell lines.
  
  3.  GTEx(version 8):The Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project is an ongoing effort to build a comprehensive public resource to study tissue-specific gene expression and regulation. Samples were collected from 54 non-diseased tissue sites across nearly 1000 individuals, primarily for molecular assays including WGS, WES, and RNA-Seq.
 
* The app visualizes gene expression across tissues and cell lines from RNAseq datasets.
